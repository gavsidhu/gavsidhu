### Hi, I'm Gavin ðŸ‘‹

I first got into programming about 3 years ago as a way to create products and services that I could use to develop my digital marketing skills. Ever since then I've been obsessed with the endless possibilities and the continuous learning that programming offers.

I am currently looking for a role in Software Engineering, ideally in an environment where I can start making an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
